Check whether eofbit is set
Returns true if the eofbit error state flag is set for the stream.

This flag is set by all standard input operations when the End-of-File is reached in the sequence associated with the stream.

Note that the value returned by this function depends on the last operation performed on the stream (and not on the next).

Operations that attempt to read at the End-of-File fail, and thus both the eofbit and the failbit end up set. This function can be used to check whether the failure is due to reaching the End-of-File or to some other reason.
